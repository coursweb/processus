## Méthodes

> **Methods** are the backbone of the design process. It's deadly tough to build products effectively without developing a few design methods first. – ZURB, [Why Design Methods Matter](https://zurb.com/blog/why-design-methods-matter)

Méthodes à définir:

- Analyzing

*Sketching* uncovers interactions, *brainstorming* sparks ideas, *critiquing* pushes the envelope of designs, and *analyzing* discovers what people do with your products. Without these methods, we'd be a little lost.
