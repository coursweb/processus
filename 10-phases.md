> "Web designers often think about the web design process with a focus on technical matters such as wireframes, code, and content management. But great design isn’t about how you integrate the social media buttons or even slick visuals. Great design is actually about creating a website that aligns with an overarching strategy."

1. Goal identification (the most important part of any web design process)
2. Scope definition (contract, gantt chart)
3. Sitemap and wireframe creation
4. Content creation
5. Visual elements (create the visual style for the site)
6. Testing
7. Launch
